# GMusic

A music website which displays the current top 100 music albums based on the iTunes API. It offers a clean, responsive design and enables the users to easily search for the desired albums based on the album title, artist's name or music genre. Moreover, clicking the play icon on the album cover image will open the complete album on Apple Music.

## Technology Stack:

- React
- TypeScript
- Bootstrap

## Additional Feature:

The **advanced search feature** allows the user to carry out advanced search using the music genre buttons and search query. Selecting any music genre will open all the albums in the selected genre and then user can type their search query to look for any album in that particular genre. This search can be carried out in the reverse order as well i.e. typing in the search query and then selecting a particular music genre.
For example, selecting "Pop" and then searching for "Harry" will display the album "Harry's House".

## Improvements

Music genres are being manually added currently but later on it can be improved to get unique music categories directly from the API.
